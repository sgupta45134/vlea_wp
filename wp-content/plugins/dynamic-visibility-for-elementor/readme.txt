Dynamic Visibility for Elementor allows you to hide any widget, column, or a section.

== Description ==

Dynamic Visibility extension allows you to hide any Elementor widget, column, or a section.
It's advantageous when you are building something that you don’t want to show everyone.
It’s an Elementor extension, so you must install Elementor Free version (also working with Elementor Pro) before activating the plugin.

- Choose an OR/AND condition.
- Limit visibility for specific custom fields or pages.
- Set a date (from–to), day of the week, or an hour and decide when each element will be visible.
- Limit visibility for specific user roles, user meta, IP, referral, or users.
- Set a fallback text (e.g.: ‘Coming soon’) for hidden elements that will be displayed in place of the element.

The element is not hidden, but it's removed from the DOM.
